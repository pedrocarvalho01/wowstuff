Bleed vs Hybrid vs Cleave/FI builds
Broad rules and Section in Guide:
If you have to ask, you should play bleed
If you're not doing +20's or higher, you should play bleed
Even if you're doing higher, you should probably play bleed
No, Fatebound is not good, you play Deathstalker in every key.

Some general concepts as to why people play different things:
11.2/Season 3: Bleed has gotten stronger through some buffs and the single target damage you get from singular focus is ridiculously good with the tier set. 
During PTR testing many high end rogues were just playing bleed everywhere.

Ease of play: Bleed build is simply the easiest to play due to subterfuge/no kingsbane/less need for giant prio targets

Boss damage: The cleave build is mainly for boss damage (note: not prio, there is no significant difference in prio). Assa single target in keys is pretty bad, 
and some bosses during season 2 were not possible on high keys otherwise. It remains to be seen what push keys in Season 3 will bring in that regard.

Specific Dungeons: Rookery as an example is very boss-heavy, especially the last boss, making bleed less ideal. Rookery is not in the rotation in Season 3, 
and there are a lot of AoE dungeons. Dawnbreaker might be a candidate, but unsure currently.

Where the damage is: Bleed spreads out its damage and does great overall due to sudden demise and powerful 3-8 target damage. 
Hybrid is competitve but doesn't pull ahead outside of low target cleave and higher target AoE. Cleave is for single target damage and insanely large aoe because of how much caustic and crimson tempest carry aoe damage. At the end of the day, the builds are extremely similar, but Bleed is looking to simply be the best.
